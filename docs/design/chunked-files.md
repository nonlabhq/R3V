# Chunked big files

Status: built.

## Why

Stored whole, a file is named by the SHA-256 of its contents. Change one
actor in a 285 MB Unreal level and the whole level would go up again —
compressed, which still leaves 40–60% of it for big `.umap` files: the rest
of a level is data Unreal already compressed (landscape, lighting).

Measured on a real Unreal project (IgnoranceOnline), with pairs of the same
level from Unreal's autosaves and copies (bytes to upload for the newer one,
as a share of its size):

| pair                                   | whole file, zstd | chunks ~1 MB, zstd |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| S1-v2, two saves the same day          | 59%                      | 0.2%               |
| S1-v2, two days apart                  | 59%                      | 0.2%               |
| S1, a week apart                       | 59%                      | 1.7%               |
| S4_2, two weeks apart                  | 47%                      | 0.2%               |
| S4_2, four months apart                | 47%                      | 0.2%               |
| S1 → S1-v2 (copied, then edited)       | 59%                      | 0.2%               |
| S4_All, a big edit (248 → 283 MB)      | 58%                      | 35% (64 KB: 24%)   |
| S4_1 → S4_All (another level)          | 58%                      | 55%                |

Chunks cut where the content says (content-defined chunking); fixed-size
chunks don't work here: an insert shifts everything after it (fixed 1 MB:
86–100% new). Chunking a 285 MB level takes ~0.6 s.

So: an everyday edit to a big level goes from ~170 MB to under 1 MB, up and
down (teammates download the same few chunks).

## The idea

Versions don't know about it: trees name each file by the SHA-256 of its
whole contents, with its size. What differs is what is stored under that
name for a big file: instead of its contents, a **chunk list** — the hashes of
the pieces, in order. The pieces are ordinary objects (compressed blobs) in
the same `objects/` folder, so identical pieces are stored once across files,
versions and projects.

```
tree:     f 9c1e…  285671001  DesertCity-S1-v2.umap
objects/9c/1e…  →  chunk list:  4a07… 1048576
                                e2b9… 893122
                                …            (~190 lines)
objects/4a/07…  →  zstd blob of those 1048576 bytes
```

A blob's header says what it is (`blob.Magic`, `\xffR3V\x01`, then the
mode). A R3V that meets a mode it doesn't know stops ("made by a newer
R3V"), never with wrong contents.

## Format

### Chunk list (blob mode `c`)

`blob.Magic` + `'c'` + zstd of text:

```
r3v-chunks 1 fastcdc-gear 262144 1048576 4194304
<chunk sha256> <size>
<chunk sha256> <size>
…
```

- Header: format, algorithm, min / average / max chunk size. Readers don't
  need the parameters (they just join the pieces); they are there so a later
  R3V can change them — the new pieces then simply don't match old ones.
- Joining the pieces must give the file: its size (from the tree) and its
  SHA-256 (the object's name) are checked on download, as for any file.
- A 285 MB file: ~190 lines, ~14 KB (hashes don't compress much).

### Chunks

Ordinary blobs: named by the SHA-256 of their own bytes, zstd when that
saves 10%, as they are otherwise.

### Chunking

Gear hash, normalized (FastCDC): no cut before 256 KB, harder to cut before
1 MB, easier after, always cut at 4 MB. The gear table is fixed (part of the
format: a different table means no piece matches an old one).

Averages measured above: 64 KB saves more on big edits (24% vs 35%) but
means 16× the objects and requests; 1 MB is as good for everyday edits.

### Which files

Files of at least **16 MB** (`chunk.MinFile`), in team storage (S3/R2) only.
Smaller files stay whole: few pieces would match, and every piece costs a
request. Unity scenes (~8 MB here) are below it and already compress to ~6%.

## Sharing (upload)

For each file to upload of at least 16 MB:

1. Read it: cut it into pieces, hashing each, and the whole (it must still
   be the content the version names). The pieces that go up are read again
   in step 3, each checked against the list.
2. Ask storage which pieces are missing (`MissingObjects`; pieces of the
   file's previous version are usually there).
3. Upload the missing pieces (compressed, as any blob), in parallel, with
   retries.
4. Write a marker `chunked/<file hash>` (see Cleanup), then the chunk list
   under the file's hash — after its pieces, as versions are written after
   their files: a chunk list is never there without its pieces.

The lease a share writes (cleanup must not delete what a share relies on)
also lists the pieces. Progress counts the bytes actually sent.

A file already stored whole stays whole; nothing is re-uploaded.

## Downloading

`GetObject(file)`: whole contents, or a chunk list. For a list:

1. Pieces this computer already has are taken from here: every big file
   uploaded or downloaded here keeps its chunk list in
   `.r3v/chunks/<hash>` (a few KB each; forgotten once the file is no
   longer on this computer), which says which pieces the file holds and
   where. Each piece read from a file here is checked against its hash; one
   that changed meanwhile is downloaded instead.
2. The rest are downloaded in parallel, each checked against its hash.
3. Pieces are written in order into the store; the whole file's SHA-256 is
   checked as for any file.

So a teammate pulling an everyday level edit downloads under 1 MB too.

## Cleanup (storage GC)

Every version's trees name the files in use; files nobody uses are
marked, then deleted a day later if still unused.

A file may be a chunk list. Cleanup finds them by their markers
(`chunked/<hash>`, one listing) and reads each list that is stored: **its
pieces are in use for as long as the list is stored, used or not.** So a
share relying on a list that is there (an upload that stopped, say) keeps
its pieces too, through the list's own lease. Once an unused list is
deleted, its pieces are marked by the next cleanup and deleted by a later
one; markers whose list is gone are deleted after a week.

Otherwise pieces are like any object: pieces uploaded in the last week are kept (a share
uploads pieces before its list), leases keep a running share's pieces (the
share leases the pieces it is about to rely on), and unused pieces are
deleted only on a second cleanup. Big files are few (hundreds), so reading
their lists adds little.

## Checking (verify)

- Locally there is nothing more to check (files are whole on this computer).
- With a team, verify checks that the team has every piece of the big files
  whose chunk lists are kept here; repair uploads missing pieces again from
  a copy here (files here first: their pieces may mend other versions).

## Compatibility

- Whole files and chunk lists mix freely (a file's older versions whole,
  newer ones chunked).
- Chunk lists are stored data: a change to their format that older R3V
  versions can't read needs a release that forces updating (`-MinVersion`).
  New chunk sizes or a new gear table only cost sharing: the new pieces
  don't match old ones.

## Costs

- First upload of a 285 MB level: ~190 objects instead of one (R2: ~$0.001).
  Compressing pieces one by one can be a little worse than the whole file
  (each piece starts afresh); to be measured.
- Every share of a changed big file asks about its ~190 pieces (one request
  each, in parallel, ~1 s). Later: skip pieces the previous version's list
  already has.
- Code: the `internal/chunk` package; upload, download, cleanup and verify
  know about chunk lists. Trees, versions, merges and the UI don't.

## Plan

1. `internal/chunk`: cutting (fixed boundaries test: same bytes, same
   pieces, forever), chunk list format.
2. Upload: chunk lists for big files, leases with pieces, progress.
3. Download: pieces from local copies, the rest from storage.
4. Cleanup and `verify --team`.
5. Tests: round trips through the fake S3 (whole, chunked, mixed); an edit
   uploads only a few pieces; cleanup keeps and deletes pieces correctly;
   flaky storage; the shuffled-files test with big files.
6. E2E: the Unreal scenario (s10) edits a level and checks the bytes sent.

## Decided

- 16 MB threshold (Unity scenes of ~8 MB stay whole: they compress to ~6%).
