// Package ext is how code outside this repository extends R3V: more
// presets (tools R3V understands), merge handlers, running-tool checks
// and backends (where a team's versions live).
//
// An extension registers what it adds before the app starts, then runs the
// app as usual:
//
//	func main() {
//		ext.RegisterPreset(unityPreset)
//		ext.RegisterRunning("unity-editor", unityOpen)
//		desktop.Run()
//	}
//
// Everything else in this repository is internal and may change; this
// package is what stays put. See docs/extending.md.
