// Package code teaches R3V about software projects: the project's
// .gitignore files are followed, the usual tool folders (node_modules,
// virtual environments, caches) and .env secrets are left out, and source
// files are merged line by line. Its priority is low: a folder that is
// also a Unity, Unreal or Live project is that. Importing it is enough.
