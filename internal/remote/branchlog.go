// The branch log: every time a branch moves (a share, a merge, a branch
// made or deleted), a record of it is added, never changed: who, when, from
// which version to which. A branch moved by mistake can be put back, and
// what happened can be read afterwards — storage keeps only where branches
// are now.
//
// One key per move (projects/<pid>/branchlog/<time>-<random>.json), so
// moves never contend for a record. Written after the move succeeded, as
// well as can be: a move isn't undone because its record didn't go up.
